        We need such a function because an arbitrary generalized Bloch
        vector does not necessarily produce a legit quantum state;
        it is likely to not be PSD. So once our neural network is 
        done making predictions, use this to map the outputs to their
        closest PSD equivalents and see if this can boost the quality
        of the reconstruction.
